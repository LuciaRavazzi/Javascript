This repo consists of projects written in Javascript programming language.
Go was born in 2009 and designed by Google's employees. It's characterized by the velocity of C but the semplicity of python. 
It's a compiled language, which means that a compiler is required to trasform the code into a low-level language code, like assembly. 
Moreover, since it's a static type language, the variable's type must be defined. 

The main explained topics are the following:

<ol>
    <li> Code/Introduction: variables, if, loops, switch, functions, structs, pointers, deferences. The tutorial was explained by Tech With Tim, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg. </li>
    <li> Code/GO-API: simple API is built. Video explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj77B59nkTQ </li>
