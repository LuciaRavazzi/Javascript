This repo consists of projects written in Javascript programming language. <br>
Javascript, along with CSS and HTML, is one of the core technologies of the WWW. Over 97% of websites uses Javascript on the client side. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
Basically, Javascript was born to add dynamicity to static pages of Netscape, which was one of the first web browsers, in 1995. Javascript was called in this way due to a marketing reason: when dot-com paradign boomed, Java was really a hot language.  < br>
